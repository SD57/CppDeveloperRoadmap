# C++ â€” It's Simple!

Modern C++ is much simpler that it is thought to be. The language changed a lot during all the years of transformation, and gained the capabilities that allow writing safe and effective code. No need to think about memory leaks if one uses the primitives of the latest standards. The compiler has also become much smarter. It can apply a tremendous amount of optimizations of your code, delivering the maximum performance. It is still possible to optimize the code by manual tweaks and tricks.

The language has shourcomings nonetheless. The main is the absense of a standard package manager. There is bunch of products that aspire to fill this niche, but to no avail yet.

ALso, C++ succumbed to its own paradigm: "The developer does not pay for what they do not need". In practice the developers of commersial software aren't too picky about the dependencies, which leads to the reverse situation: the developer pays each time they need a dependency. It leads to "interesting" side effects during the project build. Anyway, this problem is being gradually solved, too.

To get started with C++ one needs a basic set of school knowledge:
- Arithmetics
- Boolean algebra
- Drawing flowcharts
- Number representation in different numeral systems.

Despite all the background behind C++ we believe that its modern version is much simpler that it used to be.

Don't be afraid to learn it and good luck!
